              <strong>How does Jobsphere work?</strong> <br />
              Due to its widespread use as filler text for layouts, non-readability is of great importance: human perception is tuned to recognize certain patterns and repetitions in texts.

            <Text>
              <strong>What is the main process to open an account?</strong> <br />
              If the distribution of letters and 'words' is random, the reader will not be distracted from making a neutral judgement on the visual impact.

            <Text>
              <strong>How to make unlimited data entry?</strong> <br />
              Furthermore, it is advantageous when the dummy text is relatively realistic so that the layout impression of the final publication is not compromised.
            </Text>
            <Text>
              <strong>Is Jobsphere safer to use with my account?</strong> <br />
              The most well-known dummy text is the 'Lorem Ipsum', which is said to have originated in the 16th century. Lorem Ipsum is composed in a pseudo-Latin language which more or less corresponds to 'proper' Latin.
